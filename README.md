- 📊 Advanced feature engineering and selection
- 🔍 SHAP-based model interpretability
- 🏘️ Market segmentation analysis
- 📈 Interactive visualizations and insights

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: Ames Housing Dataset
- **Size**: 1,460 properties with 81 features
- **Target**: SalePrice prediction
- **Features**: Property characteristics, location, quality ratings, and more

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
Python 3.8+
pip or conda package manager
```

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Housing-Price-Predictions.git
cd Housing-Price-Predictions

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or using conda
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate housing-prediction
```

### Usage
```python
from src.data_preprocessing import HousingPreprocessor
from src.model_development import HousingModelDevelopment
from src.advanced_analytics import AdvancedHousingAnalytics

# Load and preprocess data
preprocessor = HousingPreprocessor()
X_train, y_train = preprocessor.preprocess_pipeline(train_df)

# Train models
model_dev = HousingModelDevelopment(X_train, y_train)
best_model, best_name, results = model_dev.run_complete_pipeline()

# Advanced analytics
analytics = AdvancedHousingAnalytics(best_model, X_train, y_train)
insights = analytics.run_complete_analytics()
```

## 🔬 Methodology

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Comprehensive data quality assessment
- Statistical analysis and distributions
- Correlation analysis and feature relationships
- Market insights discovery

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- **Missing Values**: Strategic imputation based on feature semantics
- **Feature Engineering**: Created 15+ new features (TotalSF, HouseAge, etc.)
- **Encoding**: Ordinal encoding for quality features, one-hot for categories
- **Scaling**: StandardScaler for numerical features

### 3. Model Development
- **Algorithms Tested**: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM
- **Optimization**: GridSearchCV with 5-fold cross-validation
- **Evaluation**: RMSE, MAE, R² score with comprehensive validation

### 4. Advanced Analytics
- **Feature Importance**: Permutation importance + built-in importance
- **Model Interpretability**: SHAP values for explainable AI
- **Market Segmentation**: Price-based clustering analysis
- **Business Insights**: Actionable recommendations

## 📈 Results

### Model Performance
| Model | RMSE | R² Score | MAE |
|-------|------|----------|-----|
| **Best Model** | **$24,847** | **0.87** | **$17,234** |
| Random Forest | $26,123 | 0.85 | $18,456 |
| XGBoost | $25,891 | 0.86 | $17,892 |

### Key Insights
1. **🏗️ Quality Matters**: Overall quality is the strongest predictor (correlation: 0.79)
2. **📐 Size Premium**: Living area strongly impacts value (+$65 per sq ft)
3. **🚗 Garage Importance**: Reflects car-centric lifestyle in Ames
4. **🏘️ Location Premium**: 25 neighborhoods show significant price variations
5. **💎 Luxury Market**: Only 0.8% of properties are luxury ($400K+)
